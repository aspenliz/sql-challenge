# sql-challenge
In this challenge we had to create tables using ERD. From there, we had to import the data from the csv’s into the tables. Next, we had to ran some data analysis on the tables. 
I was having trouble importing my csv’s. I looked through slack and found some comments made by classmates that the csv’s had to be imported in the same order as the tables were created. Once this issue was worked through, I was able to move on. 
I had to look back on past assignments to remember how to do some of the code. 
Overall, this assignment was very successful.
